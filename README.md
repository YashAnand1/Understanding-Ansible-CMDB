# Setting up servers
- We create 2 VMs // not per my req
- download package using wget & then install ansible server'spackage
- epel = extra paxkages for enterprise linux 
- To create shahee paneer/a dish we bought the ingredients by installing the main ingredient/paneer/ansible
- we need to install other dependencies/components to create a dish - these dishes are part of the package
- How will ansible server know what nodes are connected with it - what nodes it has to send updates to
- In ansible server, find ivnentory file/host default file, enter pvt ip of nodes for saving it to let server know who it is connected with "vi /etc/ansible/hosts"
- Inside the file, create a "demoByYash group" and paste node1 & 2 pvt ip
- another file in ansible: config file where commands are written but //ed, remove // before inventory & inventory file activated! also remove // before sudo-user = root (this allows future's ansible user to have the right privelege

- connection still not established b/w nodes & ansible server - we create 3 ansible users in the nodes as root user won't be known for each node practically
- "adduser user/ansible" in 3 servers, setting passwords using "passwd user/ansible"
- switching users in servers with switch user with su - ansible
- giving root privelege to ansible by editing visudo file, add:
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
- STILL have to write commands w/ sudo since you are not root user - ansible user is only a sudo user not root user
- NO communication b/w servers through ssh, come bacck to ansible server and we need to install ssh 
- make changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config & node 1 and node 2 should be allowed to connect
- create the connection in the server by creating 
- sudo apt-get install ansible
got erro "sudo ansible --version
ERROR: Ansible requires the locale encoding to be UTF-8; Detected ISO8859-1." after installing
solved by https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/z66t0l/comment/jwenrji/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 adding following to .bashrc:
```
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
```

- work as an ansible user and create necessary 
- ansible --version shows "config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg" 
- the hosts file will not work until we make chanes to ansible.cfg

- nano /etc/ansible/hosts
created a group including my vm called "demoByYash" using:
[demoByYash]
192.168.122.128

- vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg and uncommented "$ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg"

- there are only 2 files in /etc/ansible. my ansible.cfg says:
```
# Since Ansible 2.12 (core):
# To generate an example config file (a "disabled" one with all default settings, commented out):
#               $ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
#
# Also you can now have a more complete file by including existing plugins:
# ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

# For previous versions of Ansible you can check for examples in the 'stable' branches of each version
# Note that this file was always incomplete  and lagging changes to configuration settings

# for example, for 2.9: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/examples/ansible.cfg
```
so i ran ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

- adduser ansible in both machines

- su - ansible for switching to the new user

- i got an error when trying to test install httpd "sudo apt install httpd
[sudo] password for ansible: 
ansible is not in the sudoers file.
This incident has been reported to the administrator."

- to create it same as root user, i logged out of ansible user on BOTH SERVERS and ran "visudo", under the "allow root to run any commands anywhere", I addded the following:
```
ansible ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL
```

- Trust relationship: root w/ root & sser

- TO CHECK if connection has been established b/w node & server, come to server and run su - ansible and establish ssh between the 2 USERS

- when i ran ssh 192.168.122.128, i was able to connect with the node from my server

optional i think:
- changes made to /etc/ssh/sshd_config in both servers:
1. added this line: PermitRootLogin yes
2. uncommented PasswordAuthentication yes
3. outside of the file ran service sshd restart

- to verify the connection, turn ansible user first, establish ssh connection

- if i had another node, i'd have to connect to 2nd node from main server again - since i have to enter password again and again while trying to establish connection with ssh, I have to remove password authentication - not practical since we have to update 100s of server, automation with password is not feasible

- solution, we gen a key inside ansible server using ssh-keygen, one pub and one pvt, it is imp to be signed in as same level user in all servers - when creating trust relation, you need gen ssh-keygen seen using ls -a

- inside .ssh i'd see id_rsa and id_rsa_pub and when you connect using ansible@ip again, you'll be asked to enter passwd first only - 

- inside the server, add the public key on the node so that node always knows that the server is authenticate - everything to be done as an ansible user 

- first in server, run "ssh-keygen" - do ls -a and you'll find .ssh, inside is id_rsa and id_rsa.pub, copy the public key

- to copy public key to node, we run "ssh-copy-id ansible@192.168.122.12 - for the last time passwd is asked and once done, connection will be set w/o passwd

- in the nodes server, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys get created and the
id_rsa.pub is added form the server - automatically after running ssh-copy-id on the server

# Ansible-CMDB Intro

> "This tool takes the output of Ansibleâ€™s fact-gathering as its input and converts it into a static HTML overview page with all gathered system configuration information ... supports multiple types of output (HTML, csv, sql, etc) and extending information gathered by Ansible with custom data."

- CMDB = Config Management DB
- It takes output of ansible's fact gathering
- converts it into static html overview, containing config info
- It supports html, csv, txt, sql, etc. outputs
- Extension of Ansible

# Ansible-CMDB Installation

Step 1: Download Ansible-CMDB: 
- su - root 
- cd /opt
- wget https://github.com/fboender/ansible-cmdb/releases/download/1.30/ansible-cmdb-1.30.zip -O ansible-cmdb-1.30.zip

Step 2: Install Ansible-CMDB:
- unzip ansible-cmdb-1.30.zip
- cd ansible-cmdb-1.30
- yum install python-pip -y

- pip install ansible-cmdb --break-system-packages -->install

**NOTE**: I referred to the GitHub ReadMe from [here](https://github.com/fboender/ansible-cmdb/tree/1.31)

# Ansible-CMDB Demonstration 
## Viewing all configurations as HTML
- `mkdir ansible` --> `cd ansible` --> `mkdir out`
- `ansible -m setup --tree ~/ansible/out mygroup` for sending the nodes conf into out direction
- It is also possible to run as a specific user: `ansible -m setup --user=root --tree output/ all --ask-pass`
- `ansible-cmdb ~/ansible/out >  html.html` for converting the entire content of out directory into an html file
- Potential error to be faced:
  - `error: No suitable python version found (v2.7 or higher required). Aborting`
- Ran `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python` (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/673847/how-to-set-python-3-as-default-interpreter-in-linux) for setting system link (sym)
- Reran `ansible-cmdb ~/ansible/out >  html.html` - which generated the html file available for viewing configurations.
- html overview was generated in out directory, which was then moved to my host user using `sudo scp -r html.html /home/user/imsnov` 
- I then switched to the host user and ran `google-chrome html.html` inside the imsnov directory, which gave the following output:
[!img](https://i.imgur.com/6f4b4V8.png)
- By default, the `html_fancy` format is used for generating fancy html overview of configurations from out directory.
- When we don't specify the format, ansible-cmdb generates overview automatically as `html_fancy` using `ansible-cmdb --template html_fancy out/ > abcd.html` - `--template html_fancy` secretly added auto if not mentioned.
- 

## Using Templates For Other Formats
From the [Ansible-CMDB Documentation](https://ansible-cmdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/) command:
```
html_fancy: A dynamic, modern HTML page containing all hosts. **USED AS DEFAULT!!**
html_fancy_split: A dynamic, modern HTML page with each host's details in a separate file.
txt_table: A quick text table summary of the available hosts with some minimal information.
json: Dumps all hosts including groups, variable, custom info in JSON format.
csv: The CSV template outputs a CSV file of your hosts.
markdown: The Markdown template generates host information in the Markdown format.
sql: The SQL template generates an .sql file that can be loaded into an SQLite or MySQL database.
```
